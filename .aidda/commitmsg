create output file list

Analyze the code and recommend steps to take in translating the code
to Javascript for frontend and Go/WASM for backend and OpenCV
interface. The new .go, .js, .css, .html, and other files will be
created in the x/ directory and its subdirectories.  

Write the list of new files into x/MANIFEST.md.  Instead of a ASCII
drawing of a tree structure, use a list of files and directories,
e.g.:

index.html
styles.css
js/main.js
js/wasm_exec.js
...
